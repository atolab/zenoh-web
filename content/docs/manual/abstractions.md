Zenoh is a **distributed service** to define, manage and operate on **key/value** spaces.

The key abstractions at the core of zenoh are the following:

## Key
Zenoh uses **[paths](#path)** as keys. In all zenoh documentations, "key" and "path" are synonym.

---
## Path
A set of strings separated by `'/'` , as in a filesystem path. A Path cannot contain any `'*'` character.  
Examples of paths:  `/demo/example/test` , `/com/adlink/building/fr/floor/1/office/2` ...

A path can be absolute (i.e. starting with a `'/'`) or relative to a [workspace](#workspace).

---
## Path Expression
Similar to a [path](#path), but with character `'*'` allowed to express a set of paths.

 - A single `'*'` matches any set of characters in a path, except `'/'`.
 - While `"**"` matches any set of characters in a path, including `'/'`.

A path expression can be absolute (i.e. starting with a `'/'`) or relative to a [workspace](#workspace).

---
## Selector
A string which is the conjunction of an [path expression](#path-expression) identifying a set of paths and some optional parts allowing
to refine the set of **[paths](#path)** and associated **[values](#value)**.  
Structure of a selector:
```none
/s1/s2/.../sn?x>1&y<2&...&z=4(p1=v1;p2=v2;...;pn=vn)#a;b;x;y;...;z
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
```
where:

  - **expr**: is a [path expression](#path-expression).

  - **filter**: a list of predicates separated by `'&'` allowing to perform filtering on the [values](#value)
    associated with the matching keys.  
    Each predicate has the form "`field`-`operator`-`value`" where:

     - *field* is the name of a field in the value (is applicable and is existing. otherwise the predicate is false)
     - *operator* is one of a comparison operators: `<` , `>` , `<=`  , `>=`  , `=`  , `!=`
     - *value* is the the value to compare the field's value with

  - **fragment**: a list of fields names allowing to return a sub-part of each value.  
    This feature only applies to structured values using a "self-describing" encoding, such as JSON or XML.
    It allows to select only some fields within the structure. A new structure with only the selected fields
    will be used in place of the original value.
  
_**NOTE**_: _the filters and fragments are not yet supported in current zenoh version._

---
## Value
A user provided data item along with its [encoding](#encoding).

---
## Encoding
A description of the [value](#value) format, allowing zenoh to know how to encode/decode the value to/from a bytes buffer.

By default zenoh is able to transport and store any format of data as long as it's serializable as a bytes buffer.
But for advanced features such as content filtering (using [selector](#selector)) or to automatically deserialize the data
into a concrete type in the client APIs, zenoh require a description of the data encoding.


The current version of zenoh supports the following encodings for filtering and automatic deserialization:
 - **Raw**: the value is a bytes buffer
 - **StringUTF8**: the value is an UTF-8 string
 - **Json**: the value is a JSON string
 - **Properties**: the value is a string representing a list of keys/values separated by `';'` (e.g. `"k1=v1;k2=v2..."`)
 - **Integer**: the value is an integer
 - **Float**: the value is a float
 - **Custom**: the value is a bytes buffer with a free string allowing for instance to describe its encoding

---
## Timestamp
When a [value](#value) is put into zenoh, the first zenoh router receiving this value automatically
associates it with a timestamp.  
This timestamp is made of 2 items:

 - A **time** generated by a [Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)](https://cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/2014-04.pdf).
   This time is a 64-bit time with a similar structure than a NTP timestamp (but with a different epoch):
     - the higher 32-bit part is the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC
       (implying a roll over in 2106).
     - the lower 32-bit part is a fraction of second, but with the 8 last bits replaced by a counter.

     This time gives a theoritical resolution of 2^-32 seconds (60 nanoseconds), and
     guarantees that the same time cannot be generated twice and that the *happened-before* relationship is preserved.

 - The **UUID** of the zenoh router that generated the time.

Such a timestamp allows zenoh to guarantee that each value introduced into the system has a unique timestamp, and that those timestamps (and therefore the values) can be ordered in the same way at any point of the system, without the need of any consensus algorithm.

---
## Backend
A storage technology, such as DBMS, Main Memory, time-series database, etc.  
It can be dynamically loaded via the [admin space](#admin-space) and acts as a factory of [Storages](#storage).

See [Zenoh backends](../backends) chapter for details and for the list of supported backends in the current version.

---
## Storage
An entity storing keys/values on a specific [backend](#backend).

A storage is associated at its creation to a [Path Expression](#path-expression).
Storages can be created via the [admin space](#admin-space) and take responsibility for storing all keys/values whose path matches the storage selector.

---
## Subscriber
An entity registering interest for being notified whenever a key/value with a path matchings the subscriber
[selector](#selector) is put, updated or removed on zenoh.

---
## Eval
A computation registered at a specific [path](#path).

This computation can be triggered by a `get` operation on a [selector](#selector) matching this path.
The computation function will receive the selector's properties as parameter.

---
## Workspace
The abstraction that give you access to zenoh primitives.

A workspace is associated to a [path](#path) at creation. This path will be used as a prefix for any relative
[path](#path) or [selector](#selector) used with this workspace.


---
## Admin space
The administration space of zenoh allowing to administrate a zenoh router and its plugins.
It is accessible via regular get/put on zenoh, under the `/@/router/<router-id>` path prefix, where
**`<router-id>`** is the UUID of a zenoh router.
When using the REST API, you can replace the `<router-id>` with the **`local`** keyword,
meaning the operation addresses the zenoh router the HTTP client is connected to.

For instance, the following keys can be used:
* `/@/router/<router-id>` (read-only):  
  Returns a JSON with the status information about the router.
* `/@/router/<router-id>/config/**` (write-only):  
  Allows you to edit the configuration of the router at runtime.

<!-- Note that the zenoh client APIs provide an Admin interface that facilitate the addition/removal of
backends and storage. Underneath, this interface calls put/remove/get operations on those paths.
By default, this interface knows the `<router-id>` of the zenoh router it's connected to and automatically
use it in paths, if no alternative `<router-id>` is provided. -->

Some plugins may extend the admin space, such as [Storages](../plugin-storages), which will add the folling keys:
* `/@/router/<router-id>/status/plugins/storages/backends/<backend-name>` (read-only):  
  Returning information about the selected backend in JSON format
* `/@/router/<router-id>/status/plugins/storages/backends/<backend-name>/storages/<storage-name>` (read-only):  
  Returning information about the selected storage in JSON format
