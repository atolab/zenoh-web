## Module reorganization

We reorganized the module tree, so import paths are not the same as before. The main difference is that everything should be imported via the root path `zenoh::`. Here are some examples, but you can look into `zenoh/src/lib.rs` for the complete list of changes.

```rust
// common use
use zenoh::config::*;
use zenoh::{Config, Error, Result};

// key_expr & selector
use zenoh::key_expr::{
    format::{kedefine, keformat},
    keyexpr, KeyExpr, OwnedKeyExpr,
};

// session
use zenoh::session::{init, open, EntityId, Session, SessionInfo};

// publisher & subscriber
use zenoh::pubsub::{Publisher, Reliability, Subscriber};

// query & queryable & selectors
use zenoh::query::{
    ConsolidationMode, Parameters, Query, QueryConsolidation, QueryTarget, Queryable, Reply,
    Selector,
};

// ZBytes & encoding
use zenoh::bytes::{ZBytes, Encoding};

// sample
use zenoh::sample::{Locality, Sample};

// quality of service
use zenoh::qos::{CongestionControl, Priority, QoSBuilderTrait};
```

## Removal of the sync and async preludes

Zenoh preludes has been deprecated and are no more used in the API. The API has also been made asynchronous first: all operations like put/get/etc. can be awaited directly.
Making synchronous calls now requires to import `zenoh::Wait`, and use `wait()` method, replacing the old `res()` method.
To make the migration easier, there is a deprecation prompt if you use the old API convention.

```rust
// (deprecated) async
use zenoh::prelude::r#async::*;
let session = zenoh::open(config).res().await.unwrap();
let publisher = session.declare_publisher(&key_expr).res().await.unwrap();
put.res().await.unwrap();
// (deprecated) sync
use zenoh::prelude::sync::*;
let session = zenoh::open(config).res().unwrap();
let publisher = session.declare_publisher(&key_expr).res().unwrap();
put.res().unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
// async
// Difference 1: No more res()
let session = zenoh::open(config).await.unwrap();
let publisher = session.declare_publisher(&key_expr).await.unwrap();
publisher.put(buf).await.unwrap();
// sync
// Difference 2: use wait() for synchronous API
use zenoh::Wait;
let session = zenoh::open(config).wait().unwrap();
let publisher = session.declare_publisher(&key_expr).wait().unwrap();
publisher.put(buf).wait().unwrap();
```

## `Session` is now clonable and can be closed easily

`Session` implements `Clone` now, so there is no more need to wrap it into an `Arc<Session>`, and `Session::into_arc` has been deprecated. All the session methods, except `Session::close`, works like before, so only the session type need to be changed.
<br>
As a side effect, `Subscriber` and `Queryable` no longer have a generic lifetime parameter. `Publisher` also looses one of its lifetime parameters, to keep only the one of its key expression.

The session is now closed automatically when the last `Session` instance is dropped, **even if publishers/subscribers/etc. are still alive**. Session can also be manually closed using `Session::close`, which now takes an immutable reference, so it can be called anytime, even if publishers/subscribers/etc. are still alive.
<br>
Subscriber and queryable of a closed session will no longer receive data; trying to call `Session::get`, `Session::put` or `Publisher::put` will result in an error. Closing session on the fly may save bandwidth on the wire, as it avoids propagating the undeclaration of remaining entities like subscribers/queryables/etc.  

```rust
let session = zenoh::open(config).await.unwrap();
let subscriber = session
    .declare_subscriber("key/expression")
    .await
    .unwrap();
let subscriber_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Ok(sample) = subscriber.recv_async().await {
        println!("Received: {} {:?}", sample.key_expr(), sample.payload());
    }
});
// session can be closed while subscriber is still running, preventing it
// receiving more data
session.close().await.unwrap();
// subscriber task will end as `subscriber.recv_async()` will return `Err`
// **when all remaining data has been processed**.
// subscriber undeclaration has not been sent on the wire
subscriber_task.await.unwrap()
```

## Callbacks run in background until session is closed

It is now possible to declare "background" entities, e.g. subscribers, which have their callback called until the session is closed. So it is no longer needed to keep a dummy variable in scope when the intent is to have an entity living for the rest of the program.

```rust
let session = zenoh::open(config).await.unwrap();
session
    .declare_subscriber("key/ expression")
    .callback(|sample| { println!("Received: {} {:?}", sample. key_expr(), sample. payload()) })
    .background() // declare the subscriber in background
    .await
    .unwrap();
// subscriber runs in background until the session is closed
// no need to keep a variable around
```

## Value is gone, long live ZBytes

`Value` has been split into `ZBytes` and `Encoding`. `put` and other operations now require a `ZBytes` payload, and builders accept an optional `Encoding` parameter. The encoding is no longer automatically inferred from the payload type.

`ZBytes` is a raw bytes container, which can also contain non-contiguous regions of memory. It can be created directly from raw bytes/strings using `ZBytes::from`. The bytes can be retrieved using `ZBytes::to_bytes`, which returns a `Cow<[u8]>`, as a copy may have to be done if the underlying bytes are not contiguous.

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
let sample = subscriber.recv_async().await.unwrap();
let value: Value = sample.value;
let raw_bytes: Vec<u8> = value.try_into().unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
let sample = subscriber.recv_async().await.unwrap();
let zbytes: ZBytes = sample.payload();
let raw_bytes: Cow<[u8]> = zbytes.as_bytes();
```

You can look at a full set of examples in [`examples/examples/z_bytes.rs`](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/blob/1.0.0-beta.4/examples/examples/z_bytes.rs).

## Serialization

Zenoh does provide serialization for convenience as an extension in the `zenoh-ext` crate. Serialization is implemented for a bunch of standard types like integers, floats, `Vec`, `HashMap`, etc. and is used through functions `z_serialize`/`z_deserialize`.

```rust
let input: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0, 1.5, 42.0];
let payload: ZBytes = z_serialize(&input);
let output: Vec<f32> = z_deserialize(&payload).unwrap();
```

`zenoh-ext` serialization doesn't pretend to cover all use cases, as it is just one available choice among other serialization formats like JSON, Protobuf, CBOR, etc. In the end, Zenoh will just send and receive payload raw bytes independently of the serialization used.  

NOTE: ⚠️ Serialization of `Vec<u8>` is not the same as creating a `ZBytes` from a `Vec<u8>`: the resulting `ZBytes` are different, and serialization doesn't take ownership of the bytes.

## Encoding

`Encoding` has been reworked. 
Zenoh does not impose any encoding requirement on the user, nor does it operate on it. 
It can be thought of as optional metadata, carried over by Zenoh in such a way that the end user’s application may perform different operations based on encoding.
We have expanded our list of pre-defined encoding types from Zenoh 0.11.0 for user convenience.
The module path and name of the encoding have also changed.

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
use zenoh::prelude::KnownEncoding;

session
    .put(&key_expr, payload)
    .encoding(KnownEncoding::AppOctetStream)
    .res()
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
use zenoh::encoding::Encoding;
session
    .put(&key_expr, payload)
    .encoding(Encoding::APPLICATION_OCTET_STREAM)
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

Users can also define their own encoding scheme that does not need to be based on the pre-defined variants.

```rust
let encoding = Encoding::from("pointcloud/LAS");
```

Because encoding is now optional for `put`, `Publisher` can be declared with a default encoding, which will be used in every `Publisher::put`.

```rust
let publisher = session.declare_publisher("my/keyepxr").encoding(Encoding::APPLICATION_JSON).await.unwrap();
// default encoding from publisher `application/json`
publisher.put(serde_json::to_vec(json!({"key", "value"})).unwrap()).await.unwrap();
```

## Attachment

In Zenoh 0.11.x, the `AttachmentBuilder` was required to create an attachment. 
In Zenoh 1.0.0, we have removed `AttachmentBuilder`, and an attachment can be created from anything that implements `Into<ZBytes>`

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
let mut attachment = AttachmentBuilder::new();
attachment.insert("key1", "value1");
attachment.insert("key2", "value2");
publisher.put(payload)
		  	 .with_attachment(attachment.build())
		  	 .res()
		  	 .await
		  	 .unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
// Difference 1: No AttachmentBuilder anymore
//               Accept any type which can be transformed into ZBytes
let mut hashmap = HashMap::new();
hashmap.insert(String::from("key1"), String::from("value1"));
hashmap.insert(String::from("key2"), String::from("value2"));
let the_attachment = ZBytes::from(&hashmap);
// Difference 2: no with_attachment()
publisher
    .put(payload)
    .attachment(the_attachment)
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

##  API changes in Query & Queryable

Query and Queryable have been slightly reworked. 

For the API replying to a `Query` from a `Queryable` declared on a session: 
The reply function has been split into 3 separate functions variants depending on the type of reply the user wants to send.

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
let reply_ok = Ok(Sample::new(key_expr.clone(), payload.clone())); // Success
query.reply(reply_ok).res().await.unwrap();
// or 
let reply_err = Err(Value::from(payload.clone()));                 // Failure
query.reply(reply_err).res().await.unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
// No need to send Result
// For sending Succesful Reply to Query
query.reply(key_expr.clone(), payload.clone()).await.unwrap();  // Success
// For sending Error Reply to Query
query.reply_err(payload.clone()).await.unwrap();                // Failure
// For sending Delete reply to Query (Sample Kind = Delete)
query.reply_del(payload.clone()).await.unwrap();                // Delete (Success)
```

For how a Get `Query` receives the reply: 
use `result()` on the `Reply` to get the `&Sample`, 
or `into_result` to take the ownership of the `Sample`.

 `Ok` variant replies, will return `Sample`. 
 `Err` variant replies, will return `ReplyError`

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
while let Ok(reply) = replies.recv_async().await {
    match reply.sample {  // sample should be Result<Sample, Value>
        Ok(sample) => println!(
            ">> Received ('{}': '{}')",
            sample.key_expr.as_str(),
            sample.value,
        ),
        Err(value_err) => println!("{}", String::try_from(&value_err).unwrap()),
    }
}
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
while let Ok(reply) = replies.recv_async().await {
    // Difference 1: using result() to get Result<&Sample, &ReplyError>
    match reply.result() {
        Ok(sample) => {
            println!(
                ">> Received ('{}': '{}')",
                sample.key_expr().as_str(),
                // Difference 2: payload() instead of value
                sample.payload().deserialize::<String>().unwrap()
            );
        }
        // Difference 3: ReplyError instead of Value
        Err(err) => {
            println!("{}", err.payload().deserialize::<String>().unwrap());
        }
    }
}
```

We have also added the ability to get underlying Handlers from `Queryables`, so that users have direct acces to the receiver of the data channel. 

```rust
let queryable = session
    .declare_queryable(&key_expr)
    .await
    .unwrap();

let handler: &Receiver<Query> = queryable.handler();
// or mutable handler
let mut_handler:&mut Receiver<Query> = queryable.handler_mut();
```

## Use accessors to get private members

We encapsulate members of structs, and they can’t be accessed directly now. 
The only way to access Struct values is to use the getter function associated with them. 
Let’s take the subscriber as an example here.

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
while let Ok(sample) = subscriber.recv_async().await {
    println!(
        ">> [Subscriber] Received {} ('{}': '{}')",
        sample.kind,
        sample.key_expr.as_str(),
        sample.value
    );
}
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
while let Ok(sample) = subscriber.recv_async().await {
    println!(
        ">> [Subscriber] Received {} ('{}': '{:?}')",
        sample.kind(),
        sample.key_expr().as_str(),
        sample.payload()  // Ignore the deserialization
    );
}
```

## Support RingChannel to receive data

Besides using a callback to receive data, we can also receive the data from a default FIFO channel. However, sometimes we only care about the latest data and want to discard the oldest data. 
We can use `RingChannel` to get this behaviour.
You can take a look at the complete code in `examples/examples/z_pull.rs`.

```rust
let subscriber = session
    .declare_subscriber(&key_expr)
    .with(RingChannel::new(size))
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

⚠️ Note:  We **no longer** support **Pull** mode in Zenoh

To get the same behavior of a Zenoh 0.11.0 `PullSubscriber`, please make use of a `RingChannel` an example of this is illustrated in `z_pull.rs`.

## Timestamps

We now tie generating a timestamp to a Zenoh session, with the timestamp inheriting the `ZenohID` of the session.

Note that a Zenoh session will only be able to generate a timestamp if the `timestamping` configuration option is enabled.

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
let timestamp : Timestamp =  zenoh::time::new_reception_timestamp();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
let session: Session = zenoh::open(config);
// If the `timestamping` configuration is disabled, this call will return `None`.
let timestamp: Option<Timestamp> = session::new_timestamp();
```

This will affect user-created plugins and applications that need to generate timestamps.

## Feature Flags

Removed:

- `complete_n`: due to a Legacy code cleanup

## Storage

### Required option: `timestamping` enabled

Zenoh 1.0.0 introduced the possibility for Zenoh nodes configured in a mode other than `router` to load plugins.

A, somehow, implicit assumption that dictated the behaviour of storages is that the Zenoh node loading them **has to add a timestamp to any received publication that did not have one**. This functionality is controlled by the `timestamping` configuration option.

Until Zenoh 1.0.0 this assumption held true as only a router could load storage and the default configuration for a router enables `timestamping`. However, in Zenoh 1.0.0 nodes configured in `client` & `peer` mode can load storage and *their default configuration disables `timestamping`*.

⚠️ The `storage-manager` will fail to launch if the `timestamping` configuration option is disabled.

### Rewrite of the Replication

We have completely rewritten the Replication functionality in Zenoh 1.0.0. The core of the algorithm did not change, hence if you are interested in its inner workings, [our blog post unveiling this functionality](https://zenoh.io/blog/2022-11-29-zenoh-alignment/) still provides an accurate overview.

This rewrite was an opportunity to integrate many of the improvements we introduced in Zenoh since this feature was first developed. In particular, the older version was not leveraging Queryable as, at the time, they did not allow carrying attachments or payloads.

We also used this rewrite to slightly rework the configuration thus, if you were using this functionality before Zenoh 1.0.0, you will have to update the configuration of all your replicated Storage. The following configuration summarises the changes:

```json5
"plugins": {
  "storage_manager": {
    "storages": {
      "replication-test": {
        "volume": "memory",
        "key_expr": "test/replication/*",
        
        // ⚠️ This field must be identical for all Replicated Storage.
        "strip_prefix": "test/replication",

        // ⚠️ This field was previously called `replica_config`.
        "replication": {

          // ⚠️ This field was previously called `publication_interval`.
          "interval": 10,

          // ⚠️ This field replaces `delta`.
          "sub_intervals": 5,

          // This field did not change.
          "propagation_delay": 250,

          // ⚠️ These fields are new.
          "hot": 6,
          "warm": 30,
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The new `hot` and `warm` fields expose parts of the Replication algorithm. They express how many intervals are included in the Hot and Warm Eras respectively. These values control how much information is included in the Replication Digest: the higher these values are, the more information are included in the Digest (consuming more bandwidth for each Digest) but, at the same time, a misalignment will be detected and resolved faster (consuming less bandwidth when aligning).

Finally, in 1.0.0, only Replicas configured with **exactly the same parameters** will interact. This is to avoid burdening the network for no reason: if Replicas with a different configuration were to interact, they would always assume they are misaligned as, because of their different configuration, they would compute different Digests --- even when they are aligned.

The parameters that must be identical are: `key_expr`, `strip_prefix` and all the fields in `replication` (i.e. `interval`, `sub_intervals`, `propagation_delay`, `hot` and `warm`).

Note that configuring Replicas differently is equivalent to creating Replication groups: only Replicas with exactly the same configuration belong to the same group.


## Shared Memory

Shared Memory subsystem is heavily reworked and improved. The key functionality changes:

- Buffer reference counting is now robust across abnormal process termination
- Support plugging of user-defined SHM implementations
- Dynamic SHM transport negotiation: Sessions are interoperable with any combination of SHM configuration and physical location
- Support aligned allocations
- Manual buffer invalidation
- Buffer write access
- Rich buffer allocation interface

⚠️ Please note that SHM API is still unstable and will be improved in the future.

### SharedMemoryManager → ShmProvider + ShmProviderBackend

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
let id = session.zid().to_string();
let shmem_size = 1024*1024;
let mut manager = SharedMemoryManager::make(id, shmem_size).unwrap();
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
// Create an SHM backend...
let shmem_size = 1024*1024;
// Difference: each SHM Provider needs a backend that defines it's implementation
// details, like SHM system API used and allocation startegy
let backend = PosixShmProviderBackend::builder()
    .with_size(shmem_size)
    .unwrap()
    .res()
    .unwrap();
// ...and an SHM provider
let provider = ShmProviderBuilder::builder()
    .protocol_id::<POSIX_PROTOCOL_ID>()
    .backend(backend)
    .res();
// Difference: SHMProvider is not pinned to particular Session ID and it's
// buffers are OK to be published in different Sessions
```

⚠️ Backend implements `ShmProviderBackend` trait and user is free to create custom backends.

### Buffer allocation

- Zenoh 0.11.x

```rust
// Allocate SHM buffer
let mut sbuf = match manager.alloc(1024) {
    Ok(buf) => buf,
    Err(_) => {
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        println!(
            "After failing allocation the GC collected: {} bytes -- retrying",
            manager.garbage_collect()
        );
        println!(
            "Trying to de-fragment memory... De-fragmented {} bytes",
            manager.defragment()
        );
        manager.alloc(1024).unwrap()
    }
};
```

- Zenoh 1.0.0

```rust
// Allocate SHM buffer
let mut sbuf = provider
    .alloc(1024)
    // Difference: there is a rich set of policies available to control
    // allocation behavior and handle allocation failures automatically
    .with_policy::<BlockOn<Defragment<GarbageCollect>>>()
    .wait()
    .unwrap();
```
