## Peer to peer

By default Zenoh applications are configured to communicate peer to peer (`peer` mode). All applications in the local network directly communicate with each other.

![peer to peer](/img/peer_to_peer.png "peer to peer")

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: peer,
}
```

### Scouting

Zenoh applications in `peer` mode run both `multicast` and `gossip` scouting to discover other applications or Zenoh routers and connect them.

**Multicast scouting**

Zenoh applications in `peer` mode join multicast group `224.0.0.224` on UDP port `7447` and send scout messages on this address to discover local applications and routers. They automatically connect to all accessible `peer` mode applications and routers they discover. The scouting address and behavior can be configured.

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: peer,
  scouting: {
    multicast: {
      enabled: true,
      address: "224.0.0.224:7447",
      interface: "",
      autoconnect: { peer: "router|peer" },
      listen: true,
    },
  },
}
```

**Gossip scouting**

Zenoh applications in `peer` mode forward all local applications and router they already discovered to newly scouted applications. This is useful when multicast communications are not available. But applications need to connect to a first entry point to discover the rest of the system. This entry point is typically one or several Zenoh routers but can also be one or several other peers. Those entry points are configured through the `connect` section of the configuration.

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: peer,
  connect: {
    endpoints: ["192.168.1.1:7447", "192.168.1.2:7447"],
  },
  scouting: {
    gossip: {
      enabled: true,
      autoconnect: { peer: "router|peer" },
    },
  },
}
```

## Client

Communicating peer to peer implies establishing multiple sessions with multiple other peers and maintaining a state for those sessions. Maintaining such states can be undesirable for scalability reasons or because the application runs on a constrained device. In this case the Zenoh application can be configured to operate in client mode. In this mode, the application will maintain, at any given time, a single session with another process (typically a Zenoh router) that will grant it connectivity with the rest of the system.

![routed clients](/img/routed_clients.png "routed clients")

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: client,
}
```

### Scouting

Zenoh applications in `client` mode run `multicast` scouting to discover Zenoh routers and connect them. In addition, the endpoints of one or several routers can be configured in the `connect` section.

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: client,
  connect: {
    endpoints: ["192.168.1.1:7447", "192.168.1.2:7447"],
  },
```

## Peers mesh

In a mesh network, applications cannot directly connect to each other. Peer to peer and brokered communications my be impossible or undesirable. Zenoh applications in `peer` mode can run a linkstate protocol that allow them to comminucate in a mesh network.

![peers mesh](/img/peers_mesh.png "peers mesh")

**Configuration**
```
{
  mode: peer,
  routing: {
    peer: {
      mode: "linkstate",
    },
  },
}
```

Note: if a Zenoh router is used to connect a local mesh of Zenoh peers to a wider network, this router also needs to be configured with the same `routing` section.

## Zenoh router

Zenoh routers route data between clients and local subnetworks of peers. They can be deployed using any topology. They, by default, never try to interconnect themself automatically and must be configured with the endpoints of the other routers they are supposed to connect to.

![full topology](/img/full_topology.png "full topology" )

```
{
  connect: {
    endpoints: ["192.168.1.1:7447", "192.168.1.2:7447"],
  },
```
