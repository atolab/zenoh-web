First of all we would like to take a moment to wish all of you a 2020 filled with joy, health, peace and success. 

This year marks a very important landmark for us. After having kicked-off the [Eclipse Edge Native](http://edgenative.eclipse.org) working group, last December, we are bringing [zenoh](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-zenoh) to Eclipse and are starting to work on a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) rewrite of the **zenoh** router. 
As part for the rewrite we are just about to complete a review of the **zenoh** protocol and we will update the specification accordingly in the weeks to come.
