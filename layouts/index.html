          Zenoh /zeno/ is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest and computations.

          It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage,
          queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency
          that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

    <p>
      First class abstractions for <i>pub/sub</i>, <i>geo-distributed storages</i>,
      <i>query</i>, and <i>queryables</i> simplify the development of
      distributed applications, at any scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Pub/Sub</b><br>
      Zenoh provides efficient publish/subscribe primitives, supporting
      multiple levels of reliability, dynamic discovery, fragmentation, and
      wire-level batching.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Storages</b><br>
      Zenoh provides primitives for defining geo-distributed storages 
      with sharding and replication. 
      <!-- as well defined semantics for querying and aggregating. -->
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Queries and Queryables</b><br>
        Zenoh provides well-defined semantics for querying and aggregating.
        It also allows applications to register computations that will be
        triggered by queries; a simple mechanism that allows many patterns
        to be implemented, such as RPC and map-reduce.
      </p>

      Scalable
    </h3>

    <p>
      Zenoh protocol and its implementations are decentralized and can scale-out as well as 
      scale-down.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Scalable Routing</b><br>
        Zenoh provides scale-out through a scalable routing infrastructure 
        that allows your applications to be deployed at Internet scale. 
      </p>

    <p>
      <b>Low Power Networks</b><br>
      Zenoh has been designed to run across extremely constrained transports 
      such as LPWAN and LowPAN. To maximise the usable bandwidth, Zenoh can run 
      on OSI Layer 2 and has a minimal <b>wire overhead</b> of <b>4 bytes</b>.
    </p>

    <p> 
      <b>Constrained Devices</b></br>
      Zenoh implementations can be extremely resource constrained. Our smallest
      implementation takes as little as <b>300 bytes footprint </b> on an Atmel 
      8-bit microcontroller.

      Fast
    </h3>

    <p>
      Zenoh is fast to learn and extremely performant.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Fast Adoption</b><br>
      Zenoh has a very simple API that makes it extremely fast to get started 
      and productive. APIs are available for the most popular programming languages
      and more are added regularly.
    <p>

    <p>
      <b>Low Latency</b><br>
      Zenoh has an extremely low latency, thus it is appropriate for applications 
      that require extremely low overhead and reaction times. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>High Throughput</b><br>
      Zenoh delivers extremely high throughput and allows you to further
      its off-the-shelf performance through the batching API.
